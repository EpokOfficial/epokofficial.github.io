    <section class="origin" id="origin">
      <div class="origin-card">
        <h3>THE ORIGIN OF PANTHERS &amp; VAMPIRES: BLUE MOON</h3>

        <p>
          I started writing Panthers &amp; Vampires: Blue Moon after losing my birth mother. That kind of loss changes your timeline. Writing became a place to put grief when normal life didn’t have space for it. But after that, I hit a freeze that lasted years—like my mind wanted to speak, but the words wouldn’t move. For about three years, the story sat inside me, unfinished, waiting on the version of me who could carry it.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I first broke through that freeze, the original five chapters weren’t supernatural yet. It started as an urban street love fairytale—real emotion, real pain, real people—because that’s what my life looked like. Every character in this world is rooted in personality: family, friends, and people I’ve been close to in real life. It’s fiction, but it’s not fake. It’s my way of translating real relationships, real loyalty, and real pressure into a story that can live bigger than one moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then my brother passed, and I found myself drowning in a depression and in a unhealthy, toxic relationship with a very hateful woman—and it put urgency on everything. It pushed me to finish what I kept putting off, because tomorrow isn’t promised and legacy doesn’t wait. About three months ago, I had an epiphany. Not only did I snap back into who I’ve always been, but I also gained a clear vision for the book and for what truly interests me. The stories I’ve always been drawn to are vampires, witches, shapeshifters, and the supernatural.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I went back and rewrote the foundation. I rebuilt the first five chapters, created the prologue, and shifted the story into the world it was always trying to become. That meant research. That meant Salem. That meant history. The book pulls from the weight of the Salem Witch Trials era and the realities surrounding it, and it also confronts the bloodline trauma tied to the slavery of Black people and the systems that shaped America’s earliest horror stories.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inside the story, that same collision is everywhere—modern chaos and ancient forces sharing the same streets. You see it in the hospital aftermath, in what’s at stake, and in how fast the world turns when destiny gets activated.
        </p>

        <p>
          You also see it in the past—like 1692—where survival, power, and lineage are treated like crimes, and where the supernatural isn’t fantasy. It’s a language people used to endure what they couldn’t escape.
        </p>

        <p>
          At its core, this book is about people stepping into who they really are—stepping into destiny, stepping into position, stepping into their EPòK. Blue Moon is only the beginning. This is a series with multiple books already outlined, and this first release is the foundation for everything that’s coming next.

            King Pierce is a Panther shapeshifter bound to an ancient bloodline that predates modern civilization. His power is not symbolic—it is inherited, dormant until activated by trauma, violence, and loss. His body heals unnaturally fast, his tattoos react to his emotional state, and when control slips, the panther within him surfaces. King is both human and beast, protector and weapon, caught between the life he tried to live and the destiny that refuses to let him remain ordinary. His transformation places him at the center of a coming war he never asked for, but cannot escape.

Disciplined, lethal, and ancient, she carries the weight of centuries while moving through the modern world unnoticed. Her bond with King is not accidental—it is woven through fate, love, and blood. Pregnant with a child that should not exist, Xzatalia becomes the axis upon which vampires, shapeshifters, and witches begin to shift. Her existence challenges old laws, terrifies elder bloodlines, and threatens to fracture the supernatural order itself.

            Violet is an ancient Salem witch and former Keeper of forbidden knowledge, a guardian of bloodlines history tried to erase. She has lived through eras of persecution, disappearance, and silence, choosing to fade rather than die. Violet sees beyond time, senses the dead, and recognizes patterns long before others understand their meaning. When she realizes what King and Xzatalia’s child represents, she understands immediately: this is not just a birth, but a convergence—one capable of uniting or destroying the supernatural world as it exists.

Closely connected to Xzatalia, she is protective, intuitive, and already aware that the events unfolding are far larger than any single life involved. Deja understands that survival in this world depends on loyalty, preparation, and recognizing destiny before it fully reveals itself. She is not surprised by what is coming—she has been waiting for it.

      <div class="summary-card">
        <p>
          Panthers &amp; Vampires: Blue Moon is an urban supernatural tale rooted in real history, real bloodlines, and real consequences. Set in and around Salem, Massachusetts, the story pulls directly from the shadow of the Salem Witch Trials — a time when fear, power, and control erased entire bloodlines and rewrote history through violence. What was buried back then never disappeared. It adapted. It survived.
        </p>
        <p>
          The modern world sits on top of those scars. Vampires, witches, and shapeshifters move through today’s streets carrying the weight of centuries — tied not only to Salem’s past, but to the early foundations of slavery, displacement, and forced survival that shaped America itself. These aren’t fantasy creatures removed from reality. They are extensions of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the center of the story is a family bound by loyalty and pressure, trying to hold itself together as everything around them begins to crack. Love becomes dangerous. Protection turns into sacrifice. And Brian — a vampire driven by obsession and control — is willing to lose everything to claim what he believes is his, even if it means burning the world down with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a story about family, trauma, power, and inheritance. About people forced to step into roles they never wanted, in a world that doesn’t allow them to stay human for long. Blue Moon blends gritty urban realism with supernatural legacy, turning forgotten history into a living threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Missing this story means missing the beginning of something bigger. This isn’t just a book — it’s the foundation of a new urban supernatural series where history, blood, and destiny collide, and where stepping into your EPÒK isn’t a choice… it’s survival.
